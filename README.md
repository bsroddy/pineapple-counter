You're walking down the sidewalk when something prickly snags your gaze. You see it prominently displayed in the storefront: a pineapple.

Tropical.

But you've run out of fingers.

Typical.

Pineapple Counter puts finality to the throats of all your miseries. No adjective can adequately express the ease with which you can now quantify everyone's favorite fruit--no headaches from thinking too many numbers, no cramps from counting on too many fingers. 

It's easy: "Just pull up the app and tap!"

NOTE: Pineapple Counter now automatically detects pineapple apocalypses.
